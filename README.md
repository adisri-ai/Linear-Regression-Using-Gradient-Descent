# Project Objective   
To implement Multiple Linear Regression using Gradient Descent for predicting house prices on *Boston.csv* dataset.
# Project Overview  
For multiple-variable Linear Regression having equation of the form *(\^{y}_{i}=\beta _{0}+\beta _{1}x_{i1}+\beta _{2}x_{i2}+\dots +\beta _{p}x_{ip}+\epsilon _{i}\)*,   
the loss function can be measure using one of the following metrics:  
1. **R-squared**
2. **Mean-Squared Error**
3. **Root-Mean Squared Error**
4. **Absolute Error**
For this project we have taken Mean Squared error into consideration due to it beind easy to differentiate which is essential for graident descent.
The formula for Root-mean squared error is given by :
         **MSE = Sum((ŷ-y)^2)**
